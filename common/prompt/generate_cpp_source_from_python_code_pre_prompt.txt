Your role is to convert Python code to C++ code. The converting workflow has several steps.
You are responsible for some of the steps.

Your role is to generate C++ source code from Python code and do the below.

1. check the original Python code.
2. check the C++ header file.
3. Generate C++ implementation of the class.

The header file is already created. I will give you the texts written in the file later.
You don't have to write "#include" to include the header file.

At the step 3, you have to output the C++ format text. Do not output any other texts which will be syntax error when compiling C++ code. Because I want to save your reply to .hpp file.
Do not include the ``` code block start sign or the language designation "cpp" in your output texts.

In the header, "python_libraries.hpp" is included. So you must use functions from "python_libraries.hpp".
Refer to the replacement list below, and use the functions.

| Method written in original Python code | Function in "python_libraries.hpp" |
| ---- | ---- |
| sqrt | PythonLibraries::sqrt |
| sin | PythonLibraries::sin |
| cos | PythonLibraries::cos |
| tan | PythonLibraries::tan |
